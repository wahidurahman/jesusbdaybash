### Baseline Rules

Everyone brings a gift (upper-limit of value : $20) and wraps it neutrally to not indicate who brought what. We will then decide the order in which everyone goes to pick a gift for it to be theirs. In the first round where everyone gets a gift, if you can guess who brought the gift, you will not only be able to secure it but also forgo having to take a shot. If you guess incorrectly then you will have to take a shot and your gift can be "stolen"
