### Baseline Rules/Guidelines

Everyone brings a gift (upper-limit of value : $20) and wraps it neutrally to not indicate who brought what. We will then decide the order in which everyone goes to pick a gift for it to be theirs. In the first round where everyone gets a gift, if you can guess who brought the gift, you will not only be able to secure it but also forgo having to take a shot. If you guess incorrectly then you will have to take a shot and your gift can be "stolen"

### Guidelines for Gifts

$20 value (upper-limit)

Gift can be:
 - Store-bought or a craft (plz make it nice tho) 
 - Basically anything
 - Just not racist or insensitive

### Important

If you plan to partake, please either note you are by adding your name to the list below or indicating on the Notion. In doing so we can figure out the scale at which we are doing this. Thank you!
